# dog-breed-image-classifier
A project requirement for Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

In this project, I built a dog breed classification model using Python. The model takes an image of a dog as input and predicts the breed of the dog. To build the model, I used three pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG, ResNet, and AlexNet. I compared the performance of these models on the task and selected the one that performed the best. The final model achieved high accuracy on the test set and can be used to identify the breed of a dog from an image with a high degree of confidence.
